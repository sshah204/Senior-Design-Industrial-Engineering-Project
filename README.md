# Senior-Design-Industrial-Engineering-Project
This is a tool created for a Senior Design Project that I worked on for Mars Chocolate. It is called the Decision Support Tool. This tool gives a production schedule for M&Ms and tests this production schedule against random demands. A user manual for this tool and a video in my voice (ignore the awkward voice!) explaining how the tool works is included. You will need to install the OpenSolver add-in for Excel that is also included. The commented VBA code is also in the excel file. This project was done in Fall 2012 at Georgia Tech.
